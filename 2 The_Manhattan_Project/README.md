# The_Manhattan_Project

A brief about the Manhattan Project which was a top-secret U.S. government program during World War II aimed at developing the atomic bomb. It began in 1942 and involved scientists like J. Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi. The project's main facilities were in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington. The successful test of the first atomic bomb occurred on July 16, 1945, in Alamogordo, New Mexico, leading to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.
